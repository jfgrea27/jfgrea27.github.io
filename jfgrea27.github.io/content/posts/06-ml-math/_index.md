This set of articles will go through a detailed exploration of the mathematics behind ML/AI.

But why? If you can explain it (write a blog), then you understand it!

This assumes that you have the following knowledge:

- Linear Algebra: vector spaces, linearly independent, basis.
- Multi-variable calculus: chain rule, partial derivatives.
- Optimization: cost functions

There are plenty of resources online to learn the maths prerequisites.

We will cover the following:
